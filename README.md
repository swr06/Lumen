# Lumen
Lumen is a 3D renderer made by me. I picked this name a long time ago, it has nothing to do with unreal.

# Features Planned

- Model Loading powered by Assimp
- Cook Torrance BRDF
- PCSS Shadows (Contact Hardening Shadows)
- HBAO (Horizon Based Screen Space Ambient Occlusion)
- SSGI (Screen Space Global Illumination)
- SSSR (Sthochastic Screen Space Reflections)
- VXGI (Voxel GI)
- Voxel Manhattan Distance Field Acceleration
- VXAO (Voxel Ambient Occlusion)
- Voxel Reflections (Importance Sampled GGX, Physically based)
- Atmosphere Rendering (Single scattering with second scattering approximation)
- Bloom (Mip Based)
- Volumetric Lighting (or God Rays, Shadow map based)
- TAA (Temporal Anti Aliasing)
- FXAA 
- Volumetric Fog 
- Color Dithering 
- Tonemapping

# Possible Features 

- Mesh Raytracing (SAH BVH?)
- Ray Traced irradiance probes (Uniform grid? Store in SH?)

# Note

This project is purely educational. I work on them to learn more about Compute Graphics.
